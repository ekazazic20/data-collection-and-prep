 10.1140/epjst/e2020-900273-x,"Cold-weather penguins continually dive in and out of the water and get splashed by waves during the frigid Antarctic winter. Yet, even under these extreme sub-zero conditions, macroscopic ice crystals are typically not observed on their feathers. In this work, we hypothesize that the origin of the anti-icing properties of a cold-weather penguin’s feathers comes from a unique combination of the feather’s macroscopic structure, the nanoscale topography of its barbules, and the hydrophobicity of its preen oil. We show that, the combination of all three, make cold-weather penguin feathers both highly water repellant and icephobic. In this paper, we present the results from a series of droplet freezing experiments performed on feathers from a number of species of both cold-weather and warm-weather penguins. Compared to a smooth glass substrate, freezing was delayed by a factor of 30-times for drops deposited on warm-weather penguin feathers and 60-times for cold-weather penguins. The difference in freezing time between warm- and cold-weather penguins was statistically significant and can be attributed to the increase in the contact angle measured between the drop and the feather of the cold-weather penguin. This increased contact angle is the result of an increase in the hydrophobicity of the preen oil and the inclusion of nanoscale, air-trapping dimples on the surface of the barbules. The physics of this delay are explained through the development of a simple heat transfer model which demonstrates that increasing contact angle is a primary cause of increased freezing time and icephobicity. The results of this study can be used to motivate the designs of biomimetic surfaces to minimize ice formation in extreme conditions for a number of important engineering applications.",The European Physical Journal Special Topics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjst/e2020-900273-x,,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151123103844.htm
10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.027,"The discovery of the ability of microorganisms to exchange electrons with inert electrodes has triggered new areas in fundamental and applied research. However, the field is currently limited to several known electrochemically active microorganisms enriched and isolated in research laboratories. An alternative strategy is to enrich such microorganisms in their native environment by allowing them to exchange electrons with polarized solid electrodes. The use of this approach is currently limited because of a lack of available tools. We developed a low-cost, battery-operated potentiostat that is capable of controlling the potential of a working electrode and can be deployed and operated remotely, allowing the enrichment of microorganisms on electrodes in their native environment. The device was tested in four alkaline hot springs in Heart Lake Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park (with a temperature ranging from 45 οC to 91 οC and a relatively constant pH of 8.5–8.7). Microbial community analysis showed a change in microbial community structure after 32 days of polarization. The impact of polarization on microbial community was most substantial on the electrodes that generated the highest cathodic and anodic currents, suggesting a direct impact of polarization on electrode microbial community.",Journal of Power Sources,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378775319300291?via%3Dihub,,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190305135259.htm
10.1111/jav.01972,"Flight activity recorders have recently confirmed that alpine and common swifts spend the majority of their non‐breeding period on the wing, which may last 6–10 months. Here we test the hypothesis that the closely related pallid swift, a species with a breeding distribution around the Mediterranean, lead a similar aerial life‐style during its migration and wintering periods. The pallid swift usually lays two clutches in one season and therefore spends more time in the breeding area than the common swift. We successfully tracked four pallid swifts with data loggers that record light for geolocation and acceleration every 5 min to monitor flight activity. The birds wintered south of the Sahel in west Africa from the Ivory Coast to Cameroon. The pallid swifts spent the majority of their non‐breeding time in flight, especially the first two months after leaving the breeding area in autumn, while a few landing events occurred during the winter. The total time grounded was < 1%, similar to that of the common and alpine swifts. The mass specific flight metabolic rate of swifts is similar to the average non‐breeding metabolic rate of a long distance terrestrial migrant, suggesting swifts are not more likely to procure oxidative damage as a consequence of continuous flight than other migrants. The open airspace used by swifts may provide a relatively safe habitat that explain the high survival rate found in swifts.",Journal of Avian Biology,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jav.01972,,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190306110651.htm
10.1137/19M1262322,"We consider the inverse problem of localizing a prey hitting a spider Orb Web from dynamic measurements taken near the center of the web, where the spider is supposed to stay. The actual discrete Orb Web, formed by a finite number of radial and circumferential threads, is modeled as a continuous membrane. The membrane has a specific fibrous structure, which is inherited from the original discrete web, and it is subject to tensile prestress in the referential configuration. The transverse load describing the prey's impact is assumed of the form $g(t)f(x)$, where $g(t)$ is a known function of time and $f(x)$ is the unknown term depending on the position variable $x$. For axially symmetric Orb Webs supported at the boundary and undergoing infinitesimal transverse deformations, we prove a uniqueness result for $f(x)$ in terms of measurements of the transverse dynamic displacement taken on an arbitrarily small and thin ring centered at the origin of the web, for a sufficiently large interval of time. The theoretical result is illustrated by means of a numerical implementation of the identification method.

However, the formation mechanism for the voided intra-scale structure is unknown. Here we report 3D x-ray nanotomography data for the voided chitin networks of intact white scales of Cyphochilus and Lepidiota stigma. Chitin-filling fractions are found to be 31 ± 2% for Cyphochilus and 34 ± 1% for Lepidiota stigma, indicating previous measurements overestimated their density. Optical simulations using finite-difference time domain for the chitin morphologies and simulated Cahn-Hilliard spinodal structures show excellent agreement. Reflectance curves spanning filling fraction of 5-95% for simulated spinodal structures, pinpoint optimal whiteness for 25% chitin filling. We make a simulacrum from a polymer undergoing a strong solvent quench, resulting in highly reflective (~94%) white films. In-situ X-ray scattering confirms the nanostructure is formed through spinodal decomposition phase separation.

10.1111/j.1469-7998.1973.tb04553.x,"Some aspects of the energetics and mechanics of two jumps made by a single specimen of Athous haemorrhoidalis (Fab.) are considered. In the first jump, the 40 mg beetle had a take‐off velocity of 2–4 m/s and the jumping action occurred in about 064 ms; in the second jump, the take/off velocity was 2–26 m/s and the jumping action took about 0–53 ms. Energy budgets have been constructed in two different ways for each jump, and the total energy involved in each case was estimated to lie between 1–6 × 10−4 J and 3–8 × 10−4 J. Power output during the jumping action (a “catapult”) lay between 80 × 103 W/kg muscle and 180 × 103 W/kg muscle, whilst power output during the energy storing pre‐jump period (of about 0–4 s) was at least 130 W/kg muscle (at over 25°C). Forces and tensile stresses in the jumping muscles and their apodemes have also been calculated. The method of jumping appears to be fairly inefficient in that only about 50–60% of the energy expended in the jumping action is energy of translation, which actually raises the beetle.",Journal of Zoology,https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1973.tb04553.x,,,
10.1002/ar.24357,"Unlike many other mammals spending a considerable amount of time in water, river otters (Lutra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) do not have a thick layer of body fat. Instead, they have a very densely packed layer of thin underhairs. The structure of river otter hair was examined by scanning electron microscopy and polarizing light microscopy. Guard hairs were hollow and became thicker distally and then tapered to a point and had different cuticle scales in proximal and distal regions. The cuticle of the thin underhairs had a striking pattern of sharply sculpted fins with deep grooves between them; usually there were four fins at each level, rotated 45° with respect to those at an adjacent level. Underhairs varied in diameter and the scales were sometimes petal-shaped. Polarizing light microscopy images showed interlocking arrangements of the underhairs that help to impede the penetration of water. Also, these images showed that the grooves between fins or petals of underhairs entrap air bubbles. The structure of the hairs allows them to interact loosely with each other, despite variations in size and structure. Furthermore, the nature of the interactions between the fins and depressions allows space between the hairs that can trap air bubbles to increase the thermal insulation of the otter's coat.",Canadian Journal of Zoology,https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z05-047,,,
10.1007/BF01997131,"The caterpillar Caloptilia serotinella generates the force required to roll leaves by stretching the silk strands it fixes between opposable plant surfaces. The Young's modulus of strands drawn by caterpillars at an average rate of 16 mm s−1 was 1.1×108 N m−2. Single strands stretched in a tensiometer had a final Young's modulus of 1.4×109 N m−2 and withstood a maximum force of 60 × 10−5 N (i.e., a 60-mg force) before breaking at 30% extension. Strands stretched approximately 14% beyond their equilibrium length by rolling caterpillars exerted an average axially retractive force of 3.2×10−5 N and drew the leaf 7×10−3 mm into the roll. During episodes of rolling, the caterpillars spun hundreds of strands capable of generating a collective force in excess of 0.1 N. Potential forces associated with wet contraction of strands were not harnessed by the caterpillar when rolling but subsequent supercontraction of the strands caused them to bind the roll tightly. Caterpillars appeared to facilitate leaf rolling by weakening the midrib with their mandibles.",Journal of Insect Behavior,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01997131,,,
 10.3762/bjnano.5.252,"Animal attachment to a substrate is very different in terrestrial and aquatic environments. We discuss variations in both the forces acting to detach animals and forces of attachment. While in a terrestrial environment gravity is commonly understood as the most important detachment force, under submerged conditions gravity is nearly balanced out by buoyancy and therefore matters little. In contrast, flow forces such as drag and lift are of higher importance in an aquatic environment. Depending on the flow conditions, flow forces can reach much higher values than gravity and vary in magnitude and direction. For many of the attachment mechanisms (adhesion including glue, friction, suction and mechanical principles such as hook, lock, clamp and spacer) significant differences have to be considered under water. For example, the main principles of dry adhesion, van der Waals forces and chemical bonding, which make a gecko stick to the ceiling, are weak under submerged conditions. Capillary forces are very important for wet adhesion, e.g., in terrestrial beetles or flies, but usually do not occur under water. Viscous forces are likely an important contributor to adhesion under water in some mobile animals such as torrent frogs and mayflies, but there are still many open questions to be answered. Glue is the dominant attachment mechanism of sessile aquatic animals and the aquatic realm presents many challenges to this mode of attachment. Viscous forces and the lack of surface tension under submerged conditions also affect frictional interactions in the aquatic environment. Moreover, the limitation of suction to the pressure difference at vacuum conditions can be ameliorated under water, due to the increasing pressure with water depth.",Belstein Journal of Nanotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311720/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25671138/,,
10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03719,"Several types of natural molecules interact specifically with ice crystals. Small antifreeze proteins (AFPs) adsorb to particular facets of ice crystals, thus inhibiting their growth, whereas larger ice-nucleating proteins (INPs) can trigger the formation of new ice crystals at temperatures much higher than the homogeneous ice nucleation temperature of pure water. It has been proposed that both types of proteins interact similarly with ice and that, in principle, they may be able to exhibit both functions. Here we investigated two naturally occurring antifreeze proteins, one from fish, type-III AFP, and one from beetles, TmAFP. We show that in addition to ice growth inhibition, both can also trigger ice nucleation above the homogeneous freezing temperature, providing unambiguous experimental proof for their contrasting behavior. Our analysis suggests that the predominant difference between AFPs and INPs is their molecular size, which is a very good predictor of their ice nucleation temperature.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30742446/,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190307131430.htm

Through high-speed video analysis, we observe that seeds fly with extraordinary backspin of up to 1660 Hz. By modelling the seeds as spinning discs, we show that flying with backspin is stable against gyroscopic precession. This stable backspin orientation minimizes the frontal area during flight, decreasing drag force on the seeds and thus increasing dispersal distance. From high-speed video of the seeds' flight, we experimentally determine drag forces that are 40% less than those calculated for a sphere of the same volume and density. This reduces the energy costs for seed dispersal by up to a factor of five.",Journal of the Royal Society Interface,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2017.0901,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514987/,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/science/hairyflower-wild-petunia-seeds.html
10.1242/jeb.173047,"During the lifespan of the stick insect Carausius morosus, their long and narrow tibiae experience substantial compressive loads. The mechanical load on the tibiae increases as the weight of the insect rises. The increase in body weight is accompanied by a notable increase in the insect's body size and, accordingly, by an increase in the length of the tibiae. Both of these changes can raise the risk of buckling of the tibiae. In this study, we tracked changes in the material and geometric properties of the hindleg tibia of C. morosus during growth. The results show that although buckling (either by Euler buckling or local buckling) is the dominant failure mode under compression, the tibia is very capable of maintaining its buckling resistance in each postembryonic developmental stage. This is essentially the result of a compromise between the increasing slenderness of the tibia and its increasing material stiffness. The use of an optimal radius to thickness ratio, a soft resilin-dominated core, and chitin fibres oriented in both longitudinal and circumferential directions are presumably additional strategies preventing buckling of the tibia. This study, providing the first quantitative data on changes in the biomechanical properties of cuticle during the entire life of an insect, is expected to shed more light on the structure–property–function relationship in this complex biological composite.",Journal of Experimental Biology (JEB),https://jeb.biologists.org/content/221/4/jeb173047?etoc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29361600/,,
10.1098/rsbl.2016.0948,"Flamingos (Phoenicopteridae) often stand and sleep on one leg for long periods, but it is unknown how much active muscle contractile force they use for the mechanical demands of standing on one leg: body weight support and maintaining balance. First, we demonstrated that flamingo cadavers could passively support body weight on one leg without any muscle activity while adopting a stable, unchanging, joint posture resembling that seen in live flamingos. By contrast, the cadaveric flamingo could not be stably held in a two-legged pose, suggesting a greater necessity for active muscle force to stabilize two-legged versus one-legged postures. Our results suggest that flamingos engage a passively engaged gravitational stay apparatus (proximally located) for weight support during one-legged standing. Second, we discovered that live flamingos standing on one leg have markedly reduced body sway during quiescent versus alert behaviours, with the point of force application directly under the distal joint, reducing the need for muscular joint torque. Taken together, our results highlight the possibility that flamingos stand for long durations on one leg without exacting high muscular forces and, thus, with little energetic expenditure.",Journal of the Royal Society Interface,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0948?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28539457/,,
10.1111/mec.15022,"Dermal phototaxis has been reported in a few aquatic vertebrate lineages spanning fish, amphibians and reptiles. These taxa respond to light on the skin of their elongate hind‐bodies and tails by withdrawing under cover to avoid detection by predators. Here, we investigated tail phototaxis in sea snakes (Hydrophiinae), the only reptiles reported to exhibit this sensory behaviour. We conducted behavioural tests in 17 wild‐caught sea snakes of eight species by illuminating the dorsal surface of the tail and midbody skin using cold white, violet, blue, green and red light. Our results confirmed phototactic tail withdrawal in the previously studied Aipysurus laevis, revealed this trait for the first time in A. duboisii and A. tenuis, and suggested that tail photoreceptors have peak spectral sensitivities between blue and green light (457–514 nm). Based on these results, and an absence of photoresponses in five Aipysurus and Hydrophis species, we tentatively infer that tail phototaxis evolved in the ancestor of a clade of six Aipysurus species (comprising 10% of all sea snakes). Quantifying tail damage, we found that the probability of sustaining tail injuries was not influenced by tail phototactic ability in snakes. Gene profiling showed that transcriptomes of both tail skin and body skin lacked visual opsins but contained melanopsin (opn4x) in addition to key genes of the retinal regeneration and phototransduction cascades.

We demonstrate that spider dragline silk exhibits a humidity-induced torsional deformation of more than 300°/mm. When the relative humidity reaches a threshold of about 70%, the dragline silk starts to generate a large twist deformation independent of spider species. The torsional actuation can be precisely controlled by regulating the relative humidity. The behavior of humidity-induced twist is related to the supercontraction behavior of spider dragline silk. Specifically, molecular simulations of MaSp1 and MaSp2 proteins in dragline silk reveal that the unique torsional property originates from the presence of proline in MaSp2. The large proline rings also contribute to steric exclusion and disruption of hydrogen bonding in the molecule.

These nanowires were previously thought to be type IV pili composed of PilA protein. Here, we report a 3.7 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure, which surprisingly reveals that, rather than PilA, G. sulfurreducens nanowires are assembled by micrometer-long polymerization of the hexaheme cytochrome OmcS, with hemes packed within ∼3.5–6 Å of each other. The inter-subunit interfaces show unique structural elements such as inter-subunit parallel-stacked hemes and axial coordination of heme by histidines from neighboring subunits. Wild-type OmcS filaments show 100-fold greater conductivity than other filaments from a ΔomcS strain, highlighting the importance of OmcS to conductivity in these nanowires. This structure explains the remarkable capacity of soil bacteria to transport electrons to remote electron acceptors for respiration and energy sharing.

How these forces are sensed and transmitted at the molecular level is therefore an important question, one that has mainly been investigated in cultured cells in vitro. Here, we elucidate how mechanical forces are transmitted in an intact organism. We studied Drosophila muscle attachment sites, which experience high mechanical forces during development and require integrin-mediated adhesion for stable attachment to tendons. Therefore, we quantified molecular forces across the essential integrin-binding protein Talin, which links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton. Generating flies expressing 3 Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Talin tension sensors reporting different force levels between 1 and 11 piconewton (pN) enabled us to quantify physiologically relevant molecular forces. By measuring primary Drosophila muscle cells, we demonstrate that Drosophila Talin experiences mechanical forces in cell culture that are similar to those previously reported for Talin in mammalian cell lines. However, in vivo force measurements at developing flight muscle attachment sites revealed that average forces across Talin are comparatively low and decrease even further while attachments mature and tissue-level tension remains high. Concomitantly, the Talin concentration at attachment sites increases 5-fold as quantified by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), suggesting that only a small proportion of Talin molecules are mechanically engaged at any given time. Reducing Talin levels at late stages of muscle development results in muscle–tendon rupture in the adult fly, likely as a result of active muscle contractions. We therefore propose that a large pool of adhesion molecules is required to share high tissue forces. As a result, less than 15% of the molecules experience detectable forces at developing muscle attachment sites at the same time.

Specifically, using 36 songbird species and data from light and scanning electron microscopy, we examined among‐species correlations between the occurrence of sperm head abnormalities and sperm morphology, as well as the correlation between sperm head abnormalities and two indicators of sperm competition. We found that species with more helically shaped sperm heads (i.e., a wider helical membrane and more pronounced cell waveform) had a higher percentage of abnormal sperm heads than species with less helical sperm (i.e., relatively straight sperm) and that sperm head traits were better predictors of head abnormalities than total sperm length. In contrast, there was no correlation between sperm abnormalities and the level of sperm competition. Given that songbird species with more pronounced helical sperm have higher average sperm swimming speed, our results suggest an evolutionary trade‐off between sperm performance and the structural integrity of the sperm head.

Minimum leaf conductance (gmin) at 25 °C was six times lower in P. dactylifera (1.1×10–5 m s–1) than in C. colocynthis (6.9×10–5 m s–1). Additionally, gmin in the range 25–50 °C did not change in P. dactylifera but increased by a factor of 3.2 in C. colocynthis.

Wasps were trained to discriminate between five elements in series (A0B−, B0C−, C0D−, D0E−), then tested on novel, untrained pairs (B versus D). Consistent with TI, wasps chose B more frequently than D. Wasps organized the trained stimuli into an implicit hierarchy and used TI to choose between untrained pairs.

10.1140/epje/i2019-11812-1,"The length of type-I collagen fibrils in solution increases through the development and progress of pointed tips appearing successively at the two ends of an axis-symmetric shaft with constant diameter. Those tips, respectively fine (𝛼) or coarse (𝛽) have opposite molecular orientations. The 𝛼-pointed tips, the first to appear, are particularly remarkable as they all show, on most of their length, a common parabolic profile which stays constant during the growth. Assuming that the latter occurs by lateral accretion of individual molecules in staggered configuration, we propose to give account of this prominent morphological feature along a purely geometrical argument, the profile of a tip being linked to the shape of the trajectories followed all along the accretion process. Among several possible trajectories, Fermat spirals lead to a parabolic profile in perfect agreement with the one observed for 𝛼-pointed tips. This is to be put in relation with the presence of such spirals in phyllotactic patterns which ensure the best packing efficiency in cases of axis-symmetry, which is indeed that of dense collagen fibrils. Moreover, those patterns are structured by concentric circles of dislocations, constitutive of the structure itself, whose behaviour might contribute to the mechanical properties of the fibrils.",The European Physical Journal E Soft Matter and Biological Physics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepje%2Fi2019-11812-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31011856/,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190513132119.htm

The tardigrade Ramazzottius varieornatus contains a unique nuclear protein termed Dsup, for damage suppressor, which can increase the resistance of human cells to DNA damage under conditions, such as ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide treatment, that generate hydroxyl radicals. Here we find that R. varieornatus Dsup is a nucleosome-binding protein that protects chromatin from hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, a Dsup ortholog from the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris similarly binds to nucleosomes and protects DNA from hydroxyl radicals. Strikingly, a conserved region in Dsup proteins exhibits sequence similarity to the nucleosome-binding domain of vertebrate HMGN proteins and is functionally important for nucleosome binding and hydroxyl radical protection. These findings suggest that Dsup promotes the survival of tardigrades under diverse conditions by a direct mechanism that involves binding to nucleosomes and protecting chromosomal DNA from hydroxyl radicals.",eLife,https://elifesciences.org/articles/47682,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31571581/,checked,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191001102207.htm

Although much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of planar leaf development, it is unclear whether similar or distinctive mechanisms underlie shape transformations during development of more complex curved forms. Here, we use 3D imaging and cellular and clonal analysis, combined with computational modelling, to analyse the development of cup-shaped traps of the carnivorous plant Utricularia gibba. We show that the transformation from a near-spherical form at early developmental stages to an oblate spheroid with a straightened ventral midline in the mature form can be accounted for by spatial variations in rates and orientations of growth. Different hypotheses regarding spatiotemporal control predict distinct patterns of cell shape and size, which were tested experimentally by quantifying cellular and clonal anisotropy. We propose that orientations of growth are specified by a proximodistal polarity field, similar to that hypothesised to account for Arabidopsis leaf development, except that in Utricularia, the field propagates through a highly curved tissue sheet. Independent evidence for the polarity field is provided by the orientation of glandular hairs on the inner surface of the trap. Taken together, our results show that morphogenesis of complex 3D leaf shapes can be accounted for by similar mechanisms to those for planar leaves, suggesting that simple modulations of a common growth framework underlie the shaping of a diverse range of morphologies.",PLoS Biology,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31600203/,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191010142111.htm

When the local air temperature exceeds a threshold, the nests are actively ventilated by bees fanning their wings at the nest entrance. Here, we show that colonies with relatively large nest entrances use an emergent ventilation strategy where fanning bees self-organize to form groups, separating regions of continuous inflow and outflow. The observed spatio-temporal patterns correlate the air velocity and air temperature along the entrances to the distribution of fanning bees. A mathematical model that couples these variables to known fanning behaviour of individuals recapitulates their collective dynamics. Additionally, the model makes predictions about the temporal stability of the fanning group as a function of the temperature difference between the environment and the nest. Consistent with these predictions, we observe that the fanning groups drift, cling to the entrance boundaries, break-up and reform as the ambient temperature varies over a period of days. Overall, our study shows how honeybees use flow-mediated communication to self-organize into a steady state in fluctuating environments.",Journal of the Royal Society Interface,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2018.0561,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30958168/,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190208124703.htm

This unique structure was developed by nature to protect the reptile from predator attacks by sustaining impact loads and dissipating energy. In the present study we attempt to correlate the micro-scale architecture with the mechanical properties of the carapace sub-regions of the red-eared slider turtle.

10.1098/rsob.200019,"Limpets (Patella vulgata L.) are renowned for their powerful attachments to rocks on wave-swept seashores. Unlike adult barnacles and mussels, limpets do not adhere permanently; instead, they repeatedly transition between long-term adhesion and locomotive adhesion depending on the tide. Recent studies on the adhesive secretions (bio-adhesives) of marine invertebrates have expanded our knowledge on the composition and function of temporary and permanent bio-adhesives. In comparison, our understanding of the limpets' transitory adhesion remains limited. In this study, we demonstrate that suction is not the primary attachment mechanism in P. vulgata; rather, they secrete specialized pedal mucus for glue-like adhesion. Through combined transcriptomics and proteomics, we identified 171 protein sequences from the pedal mucus. Several of these proteins contain conserved domains found in temporary bio-adhesives from sea stars, sea urchins, marine flatworms and sea anemones. Many of these proteins share homology with fibrous gel-forming glycoproteins, including fibrillin, hemolectin and SCO-spondin. Moreover, proteins with potential protein- and glycan-degrading domains could have an immune defence role or assist degrading adhesive mucus to facilitate the transition from stationary to locomotive states. We also discovered glycosylation patterns unique to the pedal mucus, indicating that specific sugars may be involved in transitory adhesion. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying P. vulgata adhesion and provide opportunities for future studies on bio-adhesives that form strong attachments and resist degradation until necessary for locomotion.",Royal Society Open Biology,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.200019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32543352/,,

To climb channels inclined at 60°, we find snakes use a combination of ingenious friction-enhancing techniques, including digging their ventral scales to double their frictional coefficient and pushing channel walls transversely with up to nine times body weight.

10.1098/rspb.2003.2637,"To capture prey, chameleons ballistically project their tongues as far as 1.5 body lengths with accelerations of up to 500 m s(-2). At the core of a chameleon's tongue is a cylindrical tongue skeleton surrounded by the accelerator muscle. Previously, the cylindrical accelerator muscle was assumed to power tongue projection directly during the actual fast projection of the tongue. However, high-speed recordings of Chamaeleo melleri and C. pardalis reveal that peak powers of 3000 W kg(-1) are necessary to generate the observed accelerations, which exceed the accelerator muscle's capacity by at least five- to 10-fold. Extrinsic structures might power projection via the tongue skeleton. High-speed fluoroscopy suggests that they contribute less than 10% of the required peak instantaneous power. Thus, the projection power must be generated predominantly within the tongue, and an energy-storage-and-release mechanism must be at work. The key structure in the projection mechanism is probably a cylindrical connective-tissue layer, which surrounds the entoglossal process and was previously suggested to act as lubricating tissue. This tissue layer comprises at least 10 sheaths that envelop the entoglossal process. The outer portion connects anteriorly to the accelerator muscle and the inner portion to the retractor structures. The sheaths contain helical arrays of collagen fibres. Prior to projection, the sheaths are longitudinally loaded by the combined radial contraction and hydrostatic lengthening of the accelerator muscle, at an estimated mean power of 144 W kg(-1) in C. melleri. Tongue projection is triggered as the accelerator muscle and the loaded portions of the sheaths start to slide over the tip of the entoglossal process. The springs relax radially while pushing off the rounded tip of the entoglossal process, making the elastic energy stored in the helical fibres available for a simultaneous forward acceleration of the tongue pad, accelerator muscle and retractor structures. The energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process. This sliding-spring theory predicts that the sheaths deliver most of the instantaneous power required for tongue projection. The release power of the sliding tubular springs exceeds the work rate of the accelerator muscle by at least a factor of 10 because the elastic-energy release occurs much faster than the loading process. Thus, we have identified a unique catapult mechanism that is very different from standard engineering designs. Our morphological and kinematic observations, as well as the available literature data, are consistent with the proposed mechanism of tongue projection, although experimental tests of the sheath strain and the lubrication of the entoglossal process are currently beyond our technical scope.",Proceedings of the Royal Society B,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2003.2637,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15209111/,,
10.1038/srep18625,"Stretching elastic tissues and using their recoil to power movement allows organisms to release energy more rapidly than by muscle contraction directly, thus amplifying power output. Chameleons employ such a mechanism to ballistically project their tongue up to two body lengths, achieving power outputs nearly three times greater than those possible via muscle contraction. Additionally, small organisms tend to be capable of greater performance than larger species performing similar movements. To test the hypothesis that small chameleon species outperform larger species during ballistic tongue projection, performance was examined during feeding among 20 chameleon species in nine genera. This revealed that small species project their tongues proportionately further than large species, achieving projection distances of 2.5 body lengths. Furthermore, feedings with peak accelerations of 2,590 m s−2, or 264 g and peak power output values of 14,040 W kg−1 are reported. These values represent the highest accelerations and power outputs reported for any amniote movement, highlighting the previously underestimated performance capability of the family.

Ants are known to limit alate aphid dispersal by physically removing wings and also through chemical manipulation of the alate developmental pathway. This results in reduced dispersal and higher local densities of aphids, which benefit ants in terms of increased honeydew and prey availability. Here, we show that the walking movement of mutualistic apterous aphids is also reduced by ant semiochemicals. Aphids walk slower and their dispersal from an unsuitable patch is hampered by ants. If aphid walking dispersal has evolved as a means of natural enemy escape, then ant chemicals may act as a signal indicating protection; hence, reduced dispersal could be adaptive for aphids. If, however, dispersal is primarily a means to reduce competition or to maintain persistent metapopulations, then manipulation by ants could be detrimental.
